No matter how much you cry or plead to the Emperor, I can’t stand it anymore.” “Can I sign here?” “So if you pretend to be poor like last time, this time… what?” I waved divorce papers on an indifferent day. “I’m done. Can I go now?” “Oh, you don’t have to talk about alimony, dowry, just give me back my dowry” “What are you gonna do with that little money?” My husband, who had not cared what he had done for the past nine years, asked me a question in his voice. I laughed confidently and answered: – “I’m going to open a dessert cafe.”\n",
