  "synopsis": "Jiang Li, after crossing over, discovered he possessed no cheat abilities so he had no choice but to diligently cultivate. Five hundred years later, he became the strongest in the Nine Provinces. Suddenly, a system appeared, claiming it could help the host go from the Qi Refining stage to becoming the number one in the Nine Provinces. Jiang Li stared at the first task, lost in thought. “Host, please defeat your cousin (at the sixth level of Qi Refining).” “Your system seems to have quite a delay, doesn’t it?”",
